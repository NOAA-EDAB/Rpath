#' Rpath: A package implementing mass balance algorithms designed to work with 
#' fisheries data sources.
#'
#' The Rpath package provides two categories of important functions:
#' rpath and rsim.
#' 
#' @section rpath functions:
#' The rpath functions generate the balanced snap shot of energy flow through the
#' system.  This is done by solving a series of linear equations for unknown biomass
#' or ecotrophic efficiency.
