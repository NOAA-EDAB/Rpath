	abstract = {Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) is an effective tool to gauge the relative performance of fishery management options. For the most part, MSEs have been applied to single-species management procedures. However, to be more inclusive of all the biological and technical interactions occurring within a system, ecosystem-based strategies are emerging. In order to test the feasibility of these strategies, a full ecosystem model should be used as an operating model. Mass balance food web models include many features that managers are interested in and therefore can be useful as an operating model. Until recently, full feedback interactions between a management strategy and a mass balance operating model were impractical. However, with the development of Rpath, users now have the ability to fully customize their mass balance models. We developed new functionality for the Rpath modelling framework that allows it to be used as a flexible operating model. Using an example Georges Bank model, we demonstrate how Rpath can now pause the simulation, evaluate an external model, and use the results to modify the parameters of the operating model. This new flexibility will allow users to test a variety of management strategies or couple to other models making Rpath a valuable tool for conducting MSEs.},

A particularly useful method of characterizing the flow of energy through an ecosystem and the subsequent direct and indirect implications of management actions is mass balance modeling. Here we outline the equations as utilized in Rpath, an R implementation of the mass balance algorithms popularized by Ecopath with Ecosim that are designed to work with fisheries data sources. We believe that common practices in R will aid in the reproducibility of conducting analysis using a mass balance model as all of the code is contained within a single script file. This includes the built-in statistical and graphical functions of R. In addition to added reproducibility, R is a coding language with which ecologists are familiar. This familiarity offers greater flexibility for practitioners to tailor the model to their needs. We have made the code available on an open software development platform which should aid in continuous community development of the tool.},

	abstract = {We use a dynamic ecosystem model to evaluate the relative effects of fishing history, climate change, and predator–prey interactions in determining biomass trajectories for 12 species groups ranging from marine mammals through commercially exploited fish and invertebrates in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Ecosystem model fits under six alternative hypotheses relating fishing, climate, and predation were evaluated. Fishing alone explained few GOA biomass trajectories; it was necessary to both estimate specific predator–prey relationships and provide some mechanism for increased production. No single control hypothesis explained all species dynamics simultaneously, suggesting that in the GOA, there is no single main driver of the ecosystem. Furthermore, the alternative control hypotheses implied contrasting sets of predator–prey relationships (estimated functional response parameters). Therefore, a single set of “best fit” parameters for a given control hypothesis is unlikely to be useful in forecasting. Future modeling efforts supporting ecosystem-based fishery management could retain multiple working models to accommodate complex forcing (fishing, keystone species production, and environmental) differentially affecting components of the ecosystem.},

This, however, creates a problem with quality assurance; to address this we provide an overview of best practices for creating Ecopath models. We describe the diagnostics that can be used to check for thermodynamic and ecological principles, and highlight principles that should be used for balancing a model. We then highlight the pitfalls when comparing Ecopath models using Ecological Network Analysis indices. For dynamic simulations in Ecosim we show the state of the art in calibrating the model by fitting it to time series using a formal fitting procedure and statistical goodness of fit. Finally, we show how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to address uncertainty in input parameters, and we discuss the use of models in a management context, specifically using the concept of ‘key runs’ for ecosystem-based management. This novel list of best practices for EwE models will enable ecosystem managers to evaluate the goodness of fit of the given EwE model to the ecosystem management question.},

	abstract = {The linear equations that describe trophic fluxes in mass-balance, equilibrium assessments of ecosystems (such as in the ECOPATH approach) can be re-expressed as differential equations defining trophic interactions as dynamic relationships varying with biomasses and harvest regimes. Time patterns of biomass predicted by these differential equations, and equilibrium system responses under different exploitation regimes, are found by setting the differential equations equal to zero and solving for biomasses at different levels of fishing mortality. Incorporation of our approach as the ECOSIM routine into the well-documented ECOPATH software will enable a wide range of potential users to conduct fisheries policy analyses that explicitly account for ecosystem trophic interactions, without requiring the users to engage in complex modelling or information gathering much beyond that required for ECOPATH. While the ECOSIM predictions can be expected to fail under fishing regimes very different from those leading to the ECOPATH input data, ECOSIM will at least indicate likely directions of biomass change in various trophic groups under incremental experimental policies aimed at improving overall ecosystem management. That is, ECOSIM can be a valuable tool for design of ecosystem-scale adaptive management experiments},

	abstract = {An Ecopath-Ecosim ecosystem model under development for coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico simulates responses of 63 biomass pools to changes in fisheries and primary productivity. Ten key species are represented by detailed, multistanza population-dynamics models (31 of the biomass
pools) that attempt to account explicitly for possible changes in recruitment rates due to changes in by-catch rates and trophic interactions. Over a 1950–2004 historical reference period, the model shows good simulated agreement with time-series patterns estimated from stock assessment
and relative abundance index data for many of the species, and in particular it offers an explanation for apparent nonstationarity in natural mortality rates of menhaden (declining apparent M over time). It makes one highly counterintuitive policy prediction about impacts of management efforts
aimed at reducing by-catch in the shrimp trawl fishery, namely that by-catch reduction may cause negative impacts on productivity of several valued species [menhaden, Brevoortia patronus Goode, 1878; red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus, 1766); red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus
(Poey, 1860)] by allowing recovery of some benthic predators such as catfishes [Arius felis (Linnaeus, 1766), Bagre marinus (Mitchill, 1815)] that have been reduced by trawling but are also potentially important predators on juveniles of the valued species. Recognition of this
policy implication would have been impossible without explicit, multistanza representation of juvenile life histories and trophic interactions, because the predicted changes in predation regimes represent only very small overall biomass fluxes.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem modelling is a useful tool for exploring the potential outcomes of policy options and conducting experiments that would otherwise be impractical in the real world. However, ecosystem models have been limited in their ability to engage in the management of living marine resources due in part to high levels of uncertainty in model parameters and model outputs. Additionally, for multispecies or food web models, there is uncertainty about the predator-prey functional response, which can have implications for population dynamics. In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of large marine food webs in Alaska to parameter uncertainty, including parameters that govern the predator-prey functional response. We use Rpath, an R implementation of the food web modeling program Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE), to conduct a series of mortality-based perturbations to examine the sensitivity and recovery time of higher trophic level groups in the eastern Chukchi Sea, eastern Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska. We use a Monte Carlo approach to generate thousands of plausible ecosystems by drawing parameter sets from the range of uncertainty around the base model parameters. We subjected the ecosystem ensembles to a series of mortality-based perturbations to identify which functional groups the higher trophic level groups are most sensitive to when their mortality was increased, whether the food webs returned to their unperturbed configurations following a perturbation, and how long it took to return to that state. In all three ecosystems, we found that the number of disrupted ensemble food webs was positively related to the biomass and the number of trophic links of the perturbed functional group, and negatively related to trophic level. The eastern Chukchi Sea was most sensitive to perturbations to benthic invertebrate groups, the eastern Bering Sea was most sensitive to shrimp and walleye pollock, and the Gulf of Alaska was most sensitive to shrimps, pelagic forage fish, and zooplankton. Recovery time to perturbations were generally less than 5 years in all three ecosystems. The recovery times when fish groups were perturbed were generally longer than when benthic invertebrates were perturbed, and recovery times were shortest when it was pelagic invertebrates. The single model ensemble approach produced simulation results that described a range of possible outcomes to the prescribed perturbations and provided a sense for how robust the results are to parameter uncertainty.},
