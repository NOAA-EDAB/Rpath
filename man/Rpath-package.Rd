fisheries data sources.}
\description{
The Rpath package provides two categories of important functions:
rpath and rsim.

\section{Rpath functions}{

The Rpath functions generate the balanced snap shot of energy flow through the
system.  This is done by solving a series of linear equations for unknown biomass
or ecotrophic efficiency.
