<p>Unit Tests are written using the testthat R package. The tests are
stored in the file: <strong>tests/testthat/test-rpath.R</strong>. They
may be run explicitly by the user clicking the Test or Check buttons
under the Build tab in RStudio. They also run automatically via git
actions when the user does a push or pull request. The output of the
unit tests is a pdf file with a variety of comparison plots, examples of
which are given below in <a href="#figures">Figures 1-3.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="details">Details<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#details"></a>
</h2>
<p>Unit Tests consist of comparing a “current” model value (i.e.,
string, table) to a previously stored “baseline” value. Differences are
shown in the testing output as well as reflected in the generated plots
which are written to: <strong>Rplots.pdf</strong>. Difference
“tolerances” are defined by the variable:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">TOLERANCE</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">1e-5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>which can be modified as necessary.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="regenerating-baseline-files">Regenerating Baseline Files<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#regenerating-baseline-files"></a>
</h3>
<p>If the user needs to regenerate the baseline files, the following
variable should be set to TRUE and the tests re-run manually (by
clicking the Test button under the Build tab). This will regenerate all
of the baseline data files.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">CREATE_BASELINE_FILES</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>After the baseline files have been generated, the user should reset
the variable back:</p>

<p>The following unit tests have been developed. Note that some tests
consist of additional/finer tests that compare out_Biomass, out_Catch,

Kutta) numerical differential equation methods.</p>

<p>The Unit Tests compare current runs with baseline runs and produce
plots in a pdf file. These plots may be useful for diagnostic purposes.
The plots depict the output of a current run in blue and of the baseline
run in red. If there are no errors, then there should be no red visible
on the plots. There are two types of plots available, also set by a
variable in tests/testthat/test-rpath.R:</p>

<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">PLOT_TYPE</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">1</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<p>If PLOT_TYPE is set to 1, then the plot depicts the current model in
blue superimposed over the baseline model in red. If PLOT_TYPE is set to
2, then the difference (current-baseline) is displayed.</p>

model runs use the AB (Adams-Bashforth) numerical differential equation
method. Notice that there is no red line visible in this plot. That is,
the current (blue) line is identical (and covers completely) the
baseline (red) plot. <br><br></p>

<p><br><br> Figure 2 depicts the same information as Figure 1 with the
difference being that the randomization factor was slightly changed in
the current model from what was used in the baseline model. This was
done to only to highlight how the plot would appear if the current model
deviated from the baseline. Notice that the underlying baseline plot (in
red) is now clearly visible. <br><br></p>

<p><br><br> Figure 3 shows the difference of the current and baseline
models. If the models were identical, the difference would be 0, and the
plots should be completely flat lines. This plot shows the
current-baseline plots for the data shown in Figure 2. Notice that the
plot lines are not completely flat, denoting that the difference is not
0. The scale of the y-axis may be modified by changing the following
line in <strong>tests/testthat/test-rpath.R</strong>:</p>
